# Codingame Winter Challenge 2024 - Sprawl
This is a fork of the original referee, adding the ability to run it through commandline.

## Usage
### With Docker
If you use docker, the Dockerfile will do all the work for you, you can just:
- Build the image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t cg-winter-2024-referee .
  ```
- Use it. For example, if placed in my compiled bot (named `bot`) current directory, I can run:
  ```bash
  # command line mode
  docker run --rm -v .:/bots cg-winter-2024-referee -p1 /bots/bot -p2 /bots/bot
  # Interactive mode, open http://localhost:8888/
  docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v .:/bots cg-winter-2024-referee -p1 /bots/bot -p2 /bots/bot -s
  ```
### Build and use the jar
Building the JAR with a functional viewer has some requirements:
- JDK 17
- Maven
- a recent Node version (successfully tested with Node v20.14)
Steps:
- First build the viewer:
  ```bash
  cd src/main/resources
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- Then build the Jar:
  ```bash
  mvn package
  ```
You can then run the built Jar (located in `target/winter-2024-sprawl-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) with the command `java -jar winter-2024-sprawl-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
